# Password Cracker

This repository contains two Python scripts: `password_generator.py` and `password_cracker.py`. 

## Overview

The `password_generator.py` script generates a random password based on user-defined criteria, including the number of letters, digits, and punctuation characters. It then shuffles the generated password and saves it to a file named "password.txt".

The `password_cracker.py` script attempts to crack a password by brute force. It reads the target password from the "password.txt" file generated by the `password_generator.py` script and systematically tries all possible combinations of characters until it finds the correct password.

## Usage

### Password Generation

1. Run `password_generator.py`.
2. Enter the desired quantities of letters, digits, and punctuation characters when prompted.
3. The script will generate a random password, shuffle it for increased security, and save it to a file named "password.txt".

### Password Cracking

1. Run `password_cracker.py`.
2. Ensure that the "password.txt" file containing the target password generated by `password_generator.py` is present in the directory.
3. The script will systematically try all possible combinations of characters to crack the password.
4. Once the password is found, it will be displayed in the terminal.

## Features

- **Password Generation:** Easily generate random passwords with specified criteria.
- **Password Cracking:** Attempt to crack passwords by systematically trying all possible combinations of characters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Disclaimer

Please use the password-cracking script responsibly and only on systems and accounts you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access or attempting to crack passwords without permission is illegal and unethical.

Feel free to explore and use these scripts for educational purposes or in scenarios where you have explicit permission to test password security. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Thank you for your interest in this repository!

### Next Steps

 - [ ] Implement multithreading in `password_cracker.py` to speed up password cracking and find the password in a shorter amount of time.
